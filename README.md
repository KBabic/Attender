# Attender
## App yet in development

The aim of Attender is to help users plan their costs when attending a certain event:
- transportation costs
- accommodation costs
- event registration fee (if any)
- additional costs

It will provide a monthly overview of costs with/without selected events.

The app uses Rome2Rio.com API for planning transportation costs and Booking.com API for planning accommodation costs.
